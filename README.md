# Parallax scrolling project
The website is available [here](https://alkiki.github.io/forest_scene/)

This is the project about parallax scrolling. The topic of my website is my project from previous year that I created in Processing software. The project represents an interactive forest scene. User can also generate the fall of leaves and add wind. 

The parallax effect was created by applying the different speed to the elements as the user scrolls the page. Besides, the first section has a "3d" effect because of different images of trees layering on one another.
